# Cloud Functions

Cloud Functions for Firebase is a serverless framework that lets you automatically run backend code in response to events triggered by Firebase features and HTTPS requests. 
There's no need to manage and scale your own servers.

#### Create a Cloud Functions
1. Open the Firebase Console and create a new project.
1. Install Firebase CLI `npm install -g firebase-tools`
1. Initialize Firebase SDK for Cloud Functions
  1. Run `firebase login` to log in via the browser and authenticate the firebase tool.
  1. Go to your Firebase project directory.
  1. Run `firebase init functions`. The tool gives you an option to install dependencies with npm. It is safe to decline if you want to manage dependencies in another way.
1. The tool gives you two options for language support JavaScript and Typescript

For this tutorial, select JavaScript.
